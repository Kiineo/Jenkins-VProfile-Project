# Jenkins Project README

This README provides an overview of the Jenkins CI/CD Implementation project and its key components. The project focuses on setting up Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) to automate the build, testing, and deployment processes.

## Project Components

### EC2 Instance for Jenkins Server
- An EC2 instance is provisioned and managed to host the Jenkins Server.
- This enables continuous integration and delivery for the project.

### Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
- An Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is established to efficiently store deployable application images.
- ECR ensures seamless deployments and version control of containerized applications.

### Jenkins Pipeline
- A Jenkins Pipeline is developed and implemented to automate the CI/CD processes.
- The pipeline includes stages for code fetching, building, testing, code quality analysis, and artifact uploading.

### Dockerization
- The application is orchestrated for Dockerization.
- Docker Pipeline and AWS ECR are used for image creation and management.
